1. Selector types have increasing specificity as follows:
	0. Type selectors
	1. Class selectors
	2. ID selectors
	3. Inline styles 
	4. The !important exception

This is to be able to set a level of importance on the styling. Inline style overrides all other rules except the !important exception because this is the specificity hierarchy

2. ID's are unique to a specific element while classes are not. This means that an example would be that a single image would have an ID that you could use for styling while you could make a class to use for styling on every button on a page.

3. RGBA means Red Green Blue Alpha. You can combine Red Blu and Green to make all 24bit colors. 

4. A link element can occur either in the <head> or, if the link type is body-ok, it can occur in the body. Stylesheet is body-ok, so in general it could be placed in the body but it makes more sense to seperate <link> elements from body content if one should follow good practice.

5. The CSS selector article {} would mach all the p elements inside the article.
